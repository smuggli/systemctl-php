## How to change the binary

```php
SystemCtl::setBinary('/bin/systemctl');
```

## How to change command timeout
To change command tmeout simply call the static method `setTimeout`.
```php
SystemCtl::setTimeout(10);
```

> The default timeout is set to `3` seconds

## "I need sudo to run commands"
If you need sudo, you should execute the bin executable with sudo.
The incode support was dropped due to security reason.

## How do I start/stop/restart a unit?
Simply is that. First we instantiate a `SystemCtl` instance an load a unit from a specific type. Here we use a `Service`. You will always get back `true` if the command succeeded. Otherwise the method will throw a `CommandFailedException`.

```php
$systemCtl = new SystemCtl();

// start/stop/enable/disable/reload/restart
$systemCtl->getService('nginx')->start();
$systemCtl->getService('nginx')->stop();
```

# How to Contribute
Simply clone the repo and install using `composer`

```bash
$ composer install
```

Make your changes and make sure you run *test* and *codesniffer*.

```bash
$ composer test
> vendor/bin/phpunit tests/
